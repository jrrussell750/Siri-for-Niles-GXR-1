You can configure a raspberry pi as a Niles GXR-2 controller and then use Siri to voice control the GXR-2 through the use of shortcuts.  The concept 
is simple.  The Niles uses command strings to select zones and input devices, turn the volume up or down, and go to a previous or next selection.  These 
strings can be created and sent using an apache web server and a php page hosted on a raspbery pi.  A set of siri shortcuts can be crafted on an iPhone 
to send URLs with imbedded information to the apache server.  The php page uses the imbedded information to customize the command strings and then send 
them to the GXR-2.

		siri -> apache -> php -> GXR-2

Please note that this project assumes that you have access to a properly configured Niles GXR-2.


Overview:

I.	On a PC 
	

II.	On the raspberry pi

	1.  Connect the display, keyboard, mouse, and power supply.
	2.  Insert a micro SD card containing the Raspberry Pi OS image into the raspberry pi and boot it up.
	3.  Configure the wireless connection for access to your local network.
	4.  Verify that Apache is installed and working.
	5.  Install php.
	6.  Copy the php file from github repository.
	7.  Connect the pi's wired connection to the Expansion port of the Niles GXR-2.  

	Warning:  The Niles GXR-2 has 12 RJ-45 female ports that are used for controllers.  These ports send power to the controllers using a 
	non-standard DC voltage via pins 7 and 8.  Also, pins 4 and 5 are used to transfer ir remote signals from controllers to the GXR-2.  
	Therefore, making a connection from the wired port on the Raspberry Pi to any of the controller ports on the Niles GXR-2 may damage 
	the raspberry pi and/or the GXR-2.  Make sure you are connecting the wired port from the Raspberry Pi to the port labeled "Expansion" on
	the GXR-2.
	
	8.  Record the IP address of your raspberry pi's wireless connection for use in the shortcut(s).


III.	On your iPhone
	
	1.  Create and test first shortcut on your Iphone to Get contents of URL.
	2.  Add additional shortcut(s) as required.


Details

Items required:

  	Raspberry pi 3 or above with appropriate power supply (a power supply with an on/off switch is preferred)
	Raspberry Pi case (Optional)
	Micro SD Card
	HDMI monitor
	HDMI cable (Raspberry Pi 3) or Micro HDMI to Standard HDMI Cable (Raspberry Pi 4) 
	Keyboard with touch pad or mouse
	Computer with SD card reader (used to download and install the raspberry pi operating system on the Micro SD card)
	Access to a wireless Ethernet LAN with Internet access
	Access to a Niles GXR-2 controller in working condition
	Ethernet patch cable (raspberry pi wired LAN to GXR-2 expansion port)
	An iPhone 6 or above with IOS 15 and functioning Siri

Creating the raspberry pi OS image

	a.  Navigate to www.raspberrypi.com
	b.  Download and install the raspberry pi imager
	c.  Insert a micro SD card into the PC
	d.  Open the raspberry pi imager
	e.  


Connecting the Raspberry Pi 

	It is best to obtain a power supply that is designed to work with the raspberry pi, as some USB power supplies won't
	provide sufficient current, and the pi will not function properly.
	
	a.  Plug a USB keyboard into one of the USB connectors on the raspberry pi.
	b.  Plug a USB mouse into one of the remaining free USB connectors.
	c.  Connect an HDMI monitor to the HDMI port on the raspberry pi.  Please note that raspberry pi models below 4 have full-sized
	    HDMI connectors and raspberry pi 4's have micro HDMI connectors. 
	d.  Connect the power supply to the raspberry pi.
	
	

Copying the siri.php file from github

	This github repository contains a file called siri.php.  This file reads imbedded information from the siri shortcuts, crafts 
	command strings, and sends them to the GXR-2.  Copy this file to the /var/www/html directory on the Raspberry Pi.  You can do 
	this one of two ways:  
	
	1.  First method
		a.  Open the file in the browser on the raspberry pi
		b.  Copy the contents
		c.  Open a local file on the pi using the text editor
		d.  Paste the contents into it
		e.  Save the contents in the /home/pi directory as siri.php

	2. Second method
		a.  Navigate to the files list for this repository (https://github.com/jrrussell750/Siri-for-Niles-GXR-2)
		b.  Click on the Code button in the upper right quadrant of the screen, and then click on the Download ZIP 
		    entry on the menu that displays.
		c.  Once the download has completed, unzip the file into the /home/pi directory

Creating and testing the first shortcut

	a.  Open the siri shortcuts app.
	b.  Press the plus sign (+) in the upper right corner of the app.
	c.  Click on Shortcut Name and type in something like Turn On Niles.
	d.  Click on Add Action.  
	e.  In the search window that appears, type in Get Contents of URL.
	f.  Click on Get Contents of URL to select it.
	g.  Click on URL and enter the following:

	http://<enter ip address of your niles pi here>/siri.php?zone=<zone> Room&device=<device>

        Note:  Youâ€™ll need to use IP, zone, and device names from your system.  Also, the names are case sensitive, so make sure they are spelled 
	and capitalized correctly.  You can also edit the zone and device names in the siri.php file to make it easier to refer to them in the URL.

	h.  Test your shortcut.
